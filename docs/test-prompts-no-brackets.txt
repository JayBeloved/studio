## TEST PROMPT 1: STORYTELLING

```
FRAMEWORK: BAB

LENGTH: 350 words

TONE: Vulnerable

YOUR STORY: Worked 12 hours today on research projects despite personal challenges. Personal issues were distracting but beyond my control. I chose to focus on what I can control: delivering results for researchers and students depending on me. Stayed focused, got work done, clients satisfied.

## TEST PROMPT 2: AUTHORITY

```
FRAMEWORK: Thesis

LENGTH: 400 words

TONE: Provocative

YOUR INSIGHT: Most people think posting daily on LinkedIn is key to success. Everyone says you need consistency. The algorithm rewards frequency. But I've noticed the highest-earning creators don't post daily at all. They post 2-3 times per week with deep, thoughtful content. Their engagement per post is 10x higher than daily posters. Quality beats frequency every time.

## TEST PROMPT 3: RELEVANCE

```
FRAMEWORK: Myth

LENGTH: 300 words

TONE: Analytical

TOPIC: Everyone believes you need 10K followers on LinkedIn to be credible. The logic: big numbers equal authority. But I've been tracking who actually makes money on LinkedIn. The highest earners have 500-5K followers. They're getting client inquiries while 50K-follower accounts are getting nothing. Why? Because 500 engaged followers beat 50K passive scrollers. Credibility comes from transformation, not vanity metrics.

## TEST PROMPT 4: INVITATION

```
FRAMEWORK: Celebrate

LENGTH: 250 words

TONE: Genuine

FOCUS: I've noticed something on LinkedIn. Posts about wins get likes. Posts about struggles get comments. People saying "me too" and "thank you for saying this." Everyone shows the highlight reel. But when someone shares the struggle, the failure, the part where they didn't know what they were doing? That person gives everyone watching permission to be human. I see people doing this and it's brave. I want to celebrate them.
